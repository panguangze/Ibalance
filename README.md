# Ibalance
## Introduction
This project is for CS6491. The main introduction has been stated in the submission document. Here are some additional notes.

The main idea that using ILP to balance the SV graph is proposed by my supervisor Dr. Li. 

The **output** content includes some test files. 

my.checked.lh: The original file to construct a graph.

myseek.lh and myseek.mps.gz: Input file for Cbc ILP solver.

myseek.sol: Solution offered by Cbc

my.balance.lh: Final graph balanced by Cbc(generated by parseILP script)

This project is constructed by cmake. If you want to run this demo project, you need install Cbs lib(https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc)

## Run
step 1: Ibalance check output/my.checked.lh output/myseek

step2: cbc output/myseek.lp solve solu output/myseek.sol

step3: python main.py parseILP -i output/my.checked.lh -s output/myseek.sol -o output/my.balanced.lh
